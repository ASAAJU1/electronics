- Fix USB connecter part. The "guide holes" are not spaced properly based on the part we are using
- Add some solderless jumpers to route I2C correctly based on an RF100 or RF200

- Make sure decoupling caps are physically as close as possible to the MCP73861
- add pullups for I2C bus, done rely on RFEngine pullups.
