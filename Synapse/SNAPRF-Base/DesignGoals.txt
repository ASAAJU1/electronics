The Snap RF Base Board needs to be simple, but effective.

Must Include:
* Place to plug in RF Engine
* Standard Addon/stacking headers
* RTC (Preferably TXCO)													1010001R 	0xA2 write
* 24LC256 EEPROM for offline sotrage (at least the footprint)			1010AAAR	0xA0 write
* 24LC256 EEPROM for offline sotrage (at least the footprint)			10101AAR	0xA8 write	A2 VCC
* LM75a I2C temp sensor 3microamp shutdown ESD							1001AAAR	0x90 write
* Voltage Regulator to 3.3V
* Less than 4 sq inches.
* mounting holes
* I2C jumpers for RF100/RF200/300
* PCB Footprint for I2C Pullup resistors
* RS-232 Level converter)

Should it have:
* Bridge Rectifier so power input works eiter way?
* ADR 1 V Ref? (at least the foot print)

I2C Addressing
* PCF2129A									'1010001'R	0xA2 write
* 24LC256		'1010'210 All adr at gnd	'1010000'R	0xA0 write
* LM75A			'1001'210 All adr at gnd	'1001000'R	0x90 write

Power Budget:
MCP1802-3.3v	Iq=25-50 uA, Ishdn=0.01-0.10 uA, 
When no valid RS-232 voltages (see Figure 6)
are sensed on any receiver input for 30µs, the charge
pump and transmitters power-down, thereby reducing
supply current to 1µA. Invalid receiver levels occur
whenever the driving peripheral’s outputs are shut off
(powered down) or when the RS-232 interface cable is
disconnected. The ICL32xxE powers back up whenever it
detects a valid RS-232 voltage level on any receiver
input. This
