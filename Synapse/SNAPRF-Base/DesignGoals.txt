The Snap RF Base Board needs to be simple, but effective.

Must Include:
* Place to plug in RF Engine
* Standard Addon/stacking headers
* RTC
* Voltage Regulator to 3.3V
* Less than 4 sq inches.
* mounting holes

Should it have:
* Bridge Rectifier so power input works eiter way?
* ADR 1 V Ref? (at least the foot print)
