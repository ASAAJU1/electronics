The Snap RF Base Board needs to be simple, but effective.

Must Include:
* Place to plug in RF Engine
* Standard Addon/stacking headers
* RTC (Preferably TXCO)													'1010001' 0xA2 write
* Voltage Regulator to 3.3V
* Less than 4 sq inches.
* mounting holes
* I2C jumpers for RF100/RF200
* PCB Footprint for I2C Pullup resistors
* 24LC256 EEPROM for offline sotrage (at least the footprint)			'1010'200	0xA0 write
* RS-232 Level converter)
* LM75a I2C temp sensor 3microamp shutdown ESD							'1001'210	0x90 write

Should it have:
* Bridge Rectifier so power input works eiter way?
* ADR 1 V Ref? (at least the foot print)
